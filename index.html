                    <p class="why">Let's be real. Technology runs our world. It’s our way of life. 
                        From ebooks to prepaid bus fare, from traffic lights to home automation devices, 
                        from autonomous cars to smart toothbrushes - technology has taken over almost all aspects of life. 
                        Naturally, as technology continues to take over our world, the number of jobs opportunities in the tech industry would also skyrocketing, right?
                        According to the <a href="#">World Economic Forum</a>, job creation by the tech industry is estimated to bring 133 million new jobs by 2022. <br><br>
                        One can assume that Ontario's ministry of education to integrate more computer science to reflect the demands of the current job market, right? Yeah, you'd think they would....<br><br>
                        Unfortunately, Ontario has not updated their secondary school computer science curriculum since 2009 - 
                        a curriculum that received a D rating on an international level in 2010. 
                        And with budget cuts to education, left, right, and center, the situation likely won’t improve any time soon. </p>

                    <p class="how"> You don't need to know anything about coding for this workshop. 
                        The point of the workshop is to help you see if technology might be a viable career choice for you.
                        All you need is a laptop or chromebook, working knowledge of how to use the internet, and a parent (preferred).
                        We'll help you out with everything else.</p>

                    <p class="who">This workshop will be led by Maria Azam. Maria is a highly-skilled and passionate JavaScript developer. Although she has a background in Chemistry, Maria found the technology industry too enticing to pass up. She quickly turned to University of Toronto and graduated as a FullStacks Developer.
                            As a student at the University of Toronto, Maria quickly recognized that Canada fell far behind other countries on a global scale when it came to producing tech talent. As a result, she made it her misson to introduce youth to the technology industry.
